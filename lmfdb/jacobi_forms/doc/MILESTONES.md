  * Implement dimension formulas for Eisenstein series in joli,

  * and into the dimensions page.

  * Classıfy all lattices whıch have even or odd Jacobi modules
    of rank 1, 2, 3, .... Put in db.

    NOTE that the rank is independent of the character. Is there
    an easy explanation?

  * Extend the function 'LatticeIndex()' so to accept more complex
    string initializations.

  * Use lattice embedings to construct forms of lattice index.
